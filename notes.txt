NEEDS:
user can enter prompts in plain english
tool is able to perform the asked task
provide output in understandable english.

INPUT: 
feed data to pathway-LLM via cheet sheets right now and might integerate one of the library like python (will show a basic command like --v)
use chatgpt api to skin thru database for the right command 

OUTPUT: 
enter the output from the command line into chatgpt using sh files and running them in bash(not needed)
chatgpt explains the output 
we fine-tune to print out only the the relevent part for the user

CHALLENGES:
making the dictionary : feeding clean data-set to the pathway api 

lets say we ask it to run a python file 
it will run a python file
if there is an error it can again explain the error in simple english
